# Compliance & Accreditation

## Zauron Compliance Guarantee

Guardian Pro offers an unprecedented **Zauron Compliance Guarantee** (add-on required): If your radiologists are non-compliant with peer review requirements, our team of expert radiologists will step in to ensure your organization achieves 100% compliance. Even though we make achieving compliance with your own radiologists, practice leaders typically want to avoid the prospect of losing their accreditation or being on probation.

3. **Expert Intervention**: Our certified radiologists perform the necessary reviews when needed.  If not needed (e.g. your radiologists are fully compliant), then your cost is 0.
4. **Full Documentation**: All compliance activities are thoroughly documented and reported
