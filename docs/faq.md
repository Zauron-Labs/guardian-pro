### The system assigned me an exam type I don't regularly interpret. What should I do?

Guardian Pro includes protections to ensure you only receive cases matching your practice profile. If a mismatch occurs, you have several options:

- Click **Defer** on the case to remove it and prevent similar future assignments.
- Contact your admin to adjust the thresholds that define "regularly interpreted" exams.
- Request your admin exclude you from specific modalities, body parts, CPT codes, or combinations thereof.

### My case list is empty. Is that expected?

No. The system should always assign a minimum number of cases. An empty list indicates a system issue — please alert your administrator, who can work with the Zauron team to resolve it.

### How do I review the images and studies I've been assigned?

Your email contains a **Launch Peer Review** button. Clicking it starts your case list. After completing each case, you are automatically presented with the next one. A progress indicator shows how many cases remain. If you need to stop at any point, simply close the window — the system will resume where you left off the next time you launch.

### Are all reviews double-checked by an adjudicator?

Only reviews that meet or exceed your institution's configured threshold (e.g., a score of 2b or higher) are automatically escalated to one or more adjudicators. Optionally, the original interpreting radiologist is also notified.

### I disagree with a Learning Opportunity I received. What can I do?

Learning Opportunities are informational only and do not require acknowledgment. The criteria your organization uses to identify Learning Opportunities can be adjusted in coordination with the Zauron team.

### I'm going on parental or other extended leave. Will cases accumulate while I'm away?

Cases assigned during your absence will automatically age out after your organization's pre-defined window (default: 30 days). No action is required on your part.

### I'm a combined Breast/Body attending. Do I have to participate in peer review?

Medicare requires each radiology department to maintain accreditation, which typically includes regular peer review of each radiologist — though not necessarily active participation as a reviewer. We recommend full participation but are happy to coordinate with your department's existing peer review strategy. Additionally, Zauron Labs offers a separate service leveraging our Radiology Network to perform external peer reviews, filling any gaps in your program and helping maintain compliance.
